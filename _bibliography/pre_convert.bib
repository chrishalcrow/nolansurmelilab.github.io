abstract = {Seventy years ago George Romanes began to document the anatomical organization of the spinal motor system, uncovering a multilayered topographic plan that links the clustering and settling position of motor neurons to the spatial arrangement and biomechanical features of limb muscles. To this day, these findings have provided a structural foundation for analysis of the neural control of movement and serve as a guide for studies to explore mechanisms that direct the wiring of spinal motor circuits. In this brief essay we outline the core of Romanes's findings and place them in the context of recent studies that begin to provide insight into molecular programs that assign motor pool position and to resolve how motor neuron position shapes circuit assembly. Romanes's findings reveal how and why neuronal positioning contributes to sensory-motor connectivity and may have relevance to circuit organization in other regions of the central nervous system.}

abstract = {Summary
Sensory-motor circuits in the spinal cord are constructed with a fine specificity that coordinates motor behavior, but the mechanisms that direct sensory connections with their motor neuron partners remain unclear. The dorsoventral settling position of motor pools in the spinal cord is known to match the distal-to-proximal position of their muscle targets in the limb, but the significance of invariant motor neuron positioning is unknown. An analysis of sensory-motor connectivity patterns in FoxP1 mutant mice, where motor neuron position has been scrambled, shows that the final pattern of sensory-motor connections is initiated by the projection of sensory axons to discrete dorsoventral domains of the spinal cord without regard for motor neuron subtype or, indeed, the presence of motor neurons. By implication, the clustering and dorsoventral settling position of motor neuron pools serve as a determinant of the pattern of sensory input specificity and thus motor coordination.

Title = {Genetic and Functional Modularity of <i>Hox</i> Activities in the
   Specification of Limb-Innervating Motor Neurons},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A critical step in the assembly of the neural circuits that control
   tetrapod locomotion is the specification of the lateral motor column
   (LMC), a diverse motor neuron population targeting limb musculature.
   Hox6 paralog group genes have been implicated as key determinants of LMC
   fate at forelimb levels of the spinal cord, through their ability to
   promote expression of the LMC-restricted genes Foxp1 and Raldh2 and to
   suppress thoracic fates through exclusion of Hoxc9. The specific roles
   and mechanisms of Hox6 gene function in LMC neurons, however, are not
   known. We show that Hox6 genes are critical for diverse facets of LMC
   identity and define motifs required for their in vivo specificities.
   Although Hox6 genes are necessary for generating the appropriate number
   of LMC neurons, they are not absolutely required for the induction of
   forelimb LMC molecular determinants. In the absence of Hox6 activity,
   LMC identity appears to be preserved through a diverse array of
   Hox5-Hox8 paralogs, which are sufficient to reprogram thoracic motor
   neurons to an LMC fate. In contrast to the apparently permissive Hox
   inputs to early LMC gene programs, individual Hox genes, such as Hoxc6,
   have specific roles in promoting motor neuron pool diversity within the
   LMC. Dissection of motifs required for Hox in vivo specificities reveals
   that either cross-repressive interactions or cooperativity with Pbx
   cofactors are sufficient to induce LMC identity, with the N-terminus
   capable of promoting columnar, but not pool, identity when transferred
   to a heterologous homeodomain. These results indicate that Hox proteins
   orchestrate diverse aspects of cell fate specification through both the
   convergent regulation of gene programs regulated by many paralogs and
   also more restricted actions encoded through specificity determinants in
   the N-terminus.},

abstract = {Complementary actions of the neocortex and the hippocampus enable encoding and long-term storage of experience dependent memories. Standard models for memory storage assume that sensory signals reach the hippocampus from superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC). Deep layers of the EC on the other hand relay hippocampal outputs to the telencephalic structures including many parts of the neocortex. Here, we show that cells in layer 5a of the medial EC send a copy of their telencephalic outputs back to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Combining cell-type-specific anatomical tracing with high-throughput RNA-sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping, we show that in the mouse brain these projections have a unique topography and target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons. Our results suggest that projections of deep medial EC neurons are anatomically configured to influence the hippocampus and neocortex simultaneously and therefore lead to novel hypotheses on the functional role of the deep EC.},

Abstract = {In fragile X syndrome (FX), the leading monogenic cause of autism,
   excessive neuronal protein synthesis is a core pathophysiology; however,
   an overall increase in protein expression is not observed. Here, we
   tested whether excessive protein synthesis drives a compensatory rise in
   protein degradation that is protective for FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y)
   neurons. Surprisingly, although we find a significant increase in
   protein degra-dation through ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), this
   contributes to pathological changes. Normalizing proteasome activity
   with bortezomib corrects excessive hippocampal protein synthesis and
   hyperactivation of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in response
   to auditory stimulation. Moreover, systemic administration of bortezomib
   significantly reduces the incidence and severity of audiogenic seizures
   (AGS) in the Fmr1-/y mouse, as does genetic reduction of proteasome,
   specifically in the IC. Together, these results identify excessive
   activation of the UPS pathway in Fmr1-/y neurons as a contributor to
   multiple phenotypes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.},

Title = {Fan cells in lateral entorhinal cortex directly influence medial
   entorhinal cortex through synaptic connections in layer 1},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Standard models for spatial and episodic memory suggest that the lateral
   entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) send parallel
   independent inputs to the hippocampus, each carrying different types of
   information. Here, we evaluate the possibility that information is
   integrated between divisions of the entorhinal cortex prior to reaching
   the hippocampus. We demonstrate that, in mice, fan cells in layer 2 (L2)
   of LEC that receive neocortical inputs, and that project to the
   hippocampal dentate gyrus, also send axon collaterals to layer 1 (L1) of
   the MEC. Activation of inputs from fan cells evokes monosynaptic
   glutamatergic excitation of stellate and pyramidal cells in L2 of the
   MEC, typically followed by inhibition that contains fast and slow
   components mediated by GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, respectively.
   Inputs from fan cells also directly activate interneurons in L1 and L2
   of MEC, with synaptic connections from L1 interneurons accounting for
   slow feedforward inhibition of L2 principal cell populations. The
   relative strength of excitation and inhibition following fan cell
   activation differs substantially between neurons and is largely
   independent of anatomical location. Our results demonstrate that the
   LEC, in addition to directly influencing the hippocampus, can activate
   or inhibit major hippocampal inputs arising from the MEC. Thus, local
   circuits in the superficial MEC may combine spatial information with
   sensory and higher order signals from the LEC, providing a substrate for
   integration of `what' and `where' components of episodic memories.},

Title = {Spatial representation by ramping activity of neurons in the
   retrohippocampal cortex},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4451+},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Neurons in the retrohippocampal cortices play crucial roles in spatial
   memory. Many retrohippocampal neu-rons have firing fields that are
   selectively active at specific locations, with memory for rewarded
   locations associated with reorganization of these firing fields. Whether
   this is the sole strategy for representing spatial memories is unclear.
   Here, we demonstrate that during a spatial memory task retrohippocampal
   neurons encode location through ramping activity that extends across
   segments of a linear track approaching and following a reward, with the
   rewarded location represented by offsets or switches in the slope of the
   ramping activity. Ramping representations could be maintained
   independently of trial outcome and cues marking the reward location,
   indicating that they result from recall of the track structure. When
   recorded in an open arena, neurons that generated ramping activity
   during the spatial memory task were more numerous than grid or border
   cells, with a majority showing spatial firing that did not meet criteria
   for classification as grid or border representations. Encoding of
   rewarded locations through offsets and switches in the slope of ramping
   activ-ity also emerged in recurrent neural network models trained to
   solve a similar spatial memory task. Impaired performance of model
   networks following disruption of outputs from ramping neurons is
   consistent with this coding strategy supporting navigation to recalled
   locations of behavioral significance. Our results suggest that encoding
   of learned spaces by retrohippocampal networks employs both discrete
   firing fields and continuous ramping representations. We hypothesize
   that retrohippocampal ramping activity mediates readout of learned
   models for goal-directed navigation.},

   require high precision spatiotemporal measurements of neural activity.
   Recently developed genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) report
   both spiking and subthreshold activity of identified neurons. However,
   maximally capitalizing on the potential of GEVIs will require imaging at
   millisecond time scales, which remains challenging with standard camera
   systems. Here, application of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD)
   sensors is reported to image neural activity at kilohertz frame rates.
   SPADs are electronic devices that when activated by a single photon
   cause an avalanche of electrons and a large electric current. An array
   of SPAD sensors is used to image individual neurons expressing the GEVI
   Voltron-JF525-HTL. It is shown that subthreshold and spiking activity
   can be resolved with shot noise limited signals at frame rates of up to
   10 kHz. SPAD imaging is able to reveal millisecond scale synchronization
   of neural activity in an ex vivo seizure model. SPAD sensors may have
   widespread applications for investigation of millisecond timescale
   neural dynamics.},

Abstract = {Accurate decoding of neural signals often requires assigning
   extracellular waveforms acquired on the same electrode to their
   originating neurons, a process known as spike sorting. While many
   offline sorters are available, accurate online sorting of spikes with
   many channels is still a challenging problem. Existing online sorters
   either use simple algorithms with low accuracy, can only process a
   handful of channels, or depend on a complex runtime environment that is
   difficult to set up. We have developed a state-of-the-art online spike
   sorting platform in Python that enables large-scale, fully automatic
   real-time spike sorting and decoding on hundreds of channels. Our system
   is cross-platform and works seamlessly with the Open Ephys suite of
   open-source hardware and software widely used in many neuroscience
   laboratories worldwide. It also comes with a user-friendly graphical
   user interface to monitor the cluster quality, spike waveforms and
   neuronal firing rate. Our platform has comparable accuracy to offline
   sorters and can achieve an end-to-end sorting latency of around 160 ms
   for 128-channel signals. It will be useful for research in fundamental
   neuroscience, closed-loop feedback neuromodulation and brain-computer
   interfaces.},

Abstract = {The deep layers of the entorhinal cortex are important for spatial
   cognition, as well as memory storage, consolidation and retrieval. A
   long-standing hypothesis is that deep-layer neurons relay spatial and
   memory-related signals between the hippocampus and telencephalon. We
   review the implications of recent circuit-level analyses that suggest
   more complex roles. The organization of deep entorhinal layers is
   consistent with multi-stage processing by specialized cell populations;
   in this framework, hippocampal, neocortical, and subcortical inputs are
   integrated to generate representations for use by targets in the
   telencephalon and for feedback to the superficial entorhinal cortex and
   hippocampus. Addressing individual sublayers of the deep entorhinal
   cortex in future experiments and models will be important for
   establishing systems-level mechanisms for spatial cognition and episodic
   memory.},

Abstract = {Seizures can emerge from multiple or large foci in temporal lobe
   epilepsy, complicating focally targeted strategies such as surgical
   resection or the modulation of the activity of specific hippocampal
   neuronal populations through genetic or optogenetic techniques. Here, we
   evaluate a strategy in which optogenetic activation of medial septal
   GABAergic neurons, which provide extensive projections throughout the
   hippocampus, is used to control seizures. We utilized the chronic
   intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, which
   results in spontaneous seizures and as is often the case in human
   patients, presents with hippocampal sclerosis. Medial septal GABAergic
   neuron populations were immunohistochemically labelled and were not
   reduced in epileptic conditions. Genetic labelling with mRuby of medial
   septal GABAergic neuron synaptic puncta and imaging across the rostral
   to caudal extent of the hippocampus, also indicated an unchanged number
   of putative synapses in epilepsy. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation
   of medial septal GABAergic neurons consistently modulated oscillations
   across multiple hippocampal locations in control and epileptic
   conditions. Finally, wireless optogenetic stimulation of medial septal
   GABAergic neurons, upon electrographic detection of spontaneous
   hippocampal seizures, resulted in reduced seizure durations. We propose
   medial septal GABAergic neurons as a novel target for optogenetic
   control of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy.},

Title = {Grid cells are modulated by local head direction},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {Grid and head direction codes represent cognitive spaces for navigation
   and memory. Pure grid cells generate grid codes that have been assumed
   to be independent of head direction, whereas conjunctive cells generate
   grid representations that are tuned to a single head direction. Here, we
   demonstrate that pure grid cells also encode head direction, but through
   distinct mechanisms. We show that individual firing fields of pure grid
   cells are tuned to multiple head directions, with the preferred sets of
   directions differing between fields. This local directional modulation
   is not predicted by previous continuous attractor or oscillatory
   interference models of grid firing but is accounted for by models in
   which pure grid cells integrate inputs from co-aligned conjunctive cells
   with firing rates that differ between their fields. We suggest that
   local directional signals from grid cells may contribute to downstream
   computations by decorrelating different points of view from the same
   location. Neurons with grid firing fields are thought to play important
   roles in spatial cognition. Here, the authors show that in contrast to
   assumptions underlying current models and analyses, grid fields are
   modulated by local head direction; this suggests different mechanisms
   and new roles for grid firing.},

Title = {Inter- and intra-animal variation in the integrative properties of
   stellate cells in the medial entorhinal cortex},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Distinctions between cell types underpin organizational principles for
   nervous system function. Functional variation also exists between
   neurons of the same type. This is exemplified by correspondence between
   grid cell spatial scales and the synaptic integrative properties of
   stellate cells (SCs) in the medial entorhinal cortex. However, we know
   little about how functional variability is structured either within or
   between individuals. Using ex-vivo patch-clamp recordings from up to 55
   SCs per mouse, we found that integrative properties vary between mice
   and, in contrast to the modularity of grid cell spatial scales, have a
   continuous dorsoventral organization. Our results constrain mechanisms
   for modular grid firing and provide evidence for inter-animal phenotypic
   variability among neurons of the same type. We suggest that neuron type
   properties are tuned to circuit-level set points that vary within and
   between animals.},

Title = {Fan Cells in Layer 2 of the Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Are Critical for
   Episodic-like Memory},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {169+},

Abstract = {Episodic memory requires different types of information to be bound
   together to generate representations of experiences. The lateral
   entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampus are required for episodic like
   memory in rodents {[}1, 2]. The LEC is critical for integrating spatial
   and contextual information about objects {[}236]. Further, LEC neurons
   encode objects in the environment and the locations where objects were
   previously experienced and generate representations of time during the
   encoding and retrieval of episodes {[}7312]. However, it remains unclear
   how specific populations of cells within the LEC contribute to the
   integration of episodic memory components. Layer 2 (L2) of LEC manifests
   early pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related animal models
   {[}13-16]. Projections to the hippocampus from L2 of LEC arise from fan
   cells in a superficial sub -layer (L2a) that are immunoreactive for
   reelin and project to the dentate gyrus {[}17, 18]. Here, we establish
   an approach for selectively targeting fan cells using Siml:Cre mice.
   Whereas complete lesions of the LEC were previously found to abolish
   associative recognition memory {[}2, 3], we report that, after selective
   suppression of synaptic output from fan cells, mice can discriminate
   novel object-context configurations but are impaired in recognition of
   novel object-place-context associations. Our results suggest that memory
   functions are segregated between distinct LEC networks.},

Abstract = {Cerebellar climbing-fiber-mediated complex spikes originate from neurons
   in the inferior olive (IO), are critical for motor coordination, and are
   central to theories of cerebellar learning. Hyperpolarization-activated
   cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels expressed by IO neurons have been
   considered as pacemaker currents important for oscillatory and resonant
   dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro, network actions of HCN1
   channels enable bidirectional glutamatergic synaptic responses, while
   local actions of HCN1 channels determine the timing and waveform of
   synaptically driven action potentials. These roles are distinct from,
   and may complement, proposed pacemaker functions of HCN channels. We
   find that in behaving animals HCN1 channels reduce variability in the
   timing of cerebellar complex spikes, which serve as a readout of IO
   spiking. Our results suggest that spatially distributed actions of HCN1
   channels enable the IO to implement network-wide rules for synaptic
   integration that modulate the timing of cerebellar climbing fiber
   signals.},

Abstract = {Spatial learning requires estimates of location that may be obtained by
   path integration or from positional cues. Grid and other spatial firing
   patterns of neurons in the superficial medial entorhinal cortex (MEC)
   suggest roles in behavioral estimation of location. However,
   distinguishing the contributions of path integration and cue-based
   signals to spatial behaviors is challenging, and the roles of identified
   MEC neurons are unclear. We use virtual reality to dissociate linear
   path integration from other strategies for behavioral estimation of
   location. We find that mice learn to path integrate using motor-related
   self-motion signals, with accuracy that decreases steeply as a function
   of distance. We show that inactivation of stellate cells in superficial
   MEC impairs spatial learning in virtual reality and in a real world
   object location recognition task. Our results quantify contributions of
   path integration to behavior and corroborate key predictions of models
   in which stellate cells contribute to location estimation.},

Title = {Active integration of glutamatergic input to the inferior olive
   generates bidirectional postsynaptic potentials},

Volume = {595},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The inferior olive plays a critical role in motor coordination and
   learning by integrating diverse afferent signals to generate climbing
   fibre inputs to the cerebellar cortex. While it is well established that
   climbing fibre signals are important for motor coordination, the
   mechanisms by which neurones in the inferior olive integrate synaptic
   inputs and the roles of particular ion channels are unclear. Here, we
   test the hypothesis that neurones in the inferior olive actively
   integrate glutamatergic synaptic inputs. We demonstrate that
   optogenetically activated long-range synaptic inputs to the inferior
   olive, including projections from the motor cortex, generate rapid
   excitatory potentials followed by slower inhibitory potentials. Synaptic
   projections from the motor cortex preferentially target the principal
   olivary nucleus. We show that inhibitory and excitatory components of
   the bidirectional synaptic potentials are dependent upon AMPA (GluA)
   receptors, are GABA(A) independent, and originate from the same
   presynaptic axons. Consistent with models that predict active
   integration of synaptic inputs by inferior olive neurones, we find that
   the inhibitory component is reduced by blocking large conductance
   calcium-activated potassium channels with iberiotoxin, and is abolished
   by blocking small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels with
   apamin. Summation of excitatory components of synaptic responses to
   inputs at intervals 20ms is increased by apamin, suggesting a role for
   the inhibitory component of glutamatergic responses in temporal
   integration. Our results indicate that neurones in the inferior olive
   implement novel rules for synaptic integration and suggest new
   principles for the contribution of inferior olive neurones to
   coordinated motor behaviours.},

Title = {Flexible theta sequence compression mediated via phase precessing
   interneurons},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Encoding of behavioral episodes as spike sequences during hippocampal
   theta oscillations provides a neural substrate for computations on
   events extended across time and space. However, the mechanisms
   underlying the numerous and diverse experimentally observed properties
   of theta sequences remain poorly understood. Here we account for theta
   sequences using a novel model constrained by the septo-hippocampal
   circuitry. We show that when spontaneously active interneurons integrate
   spatial signals and theta frequency pacemaker inputs, they generate
   phase precessing action potentials that can coordinate theta sequences
   in place cell populations. We reveal novel constraints on sequence
   generation, predict cellular properties and neural dynamics that
   characterize sequence compression, identify circuit organization
   principles for high capacity sequential representation, and show that
   theta sequences can be used as substrates for association of conditioned
   stimuli with recent and upcoming events. Our results suggest mechanisms
   for flexible sequence compression that are suited to associative
   learning across an animals lifespan.},

Title = {Continuous attractor network models of grid cell firing based on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {594},
Number = {22},
Pages = {6547-6557},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex encode location through spatial
   firing fields that have a grid-like organisation. The challenge of
   identifying mechanisms for grid firing has been addressed through
   experimental and theoretical investigations of medial entorhinal
   circuits. Here, we discuss evidence for continuous attractor network
   models that account for grid firing by synaptic interactions between
   excitatory and inhibitory cells. These models assume that grid-like
   firing patterns are the result of computation of location from velocity
   inputs, with additional spatial input required to oppose drift in the
   attractor state. We focus on properties of continuous attractor networks
   that are revealed by explicitly considering excitatory and inhibitory
   neurons, their connectivity and their membrane potential dynamics.
   Models at this level of detail can account for theta-nested gamma
   oscillations as well as grid firing, predict spatial firing of
   interneurons as well as excitatory cells, show how gamma oscillations
   can bemodulated independently from spatial computations, reveal critical
   roles for neuronal noise, and demonstrate that only a subset of
   excitatory cells in a network need have grid-like firing fields.
   Evaluating experimental data against predictions from detailed network
   models will be important for establishing the mechanisms mediating grid
   firing.},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Deep layers of the medial entorhinal cortex are considered to relay
   signals from the hippocampus to other brain structures, but pathways for
   routing of signals to and from the deep layers are not well established.
   Delineating these pathways is important for a circuit level
   understanding of spatial cognition and memory. We find that neurons in
   layers 5a and 5b have distinct molecular identities, defined by the
   transcription factors Etv1 and Ctip2, and divergent targets, with
   extensive intratelencephalic projections originating in layer 5a, but
   not 5b. This segregation of outputs is mirrored by the organization of
   glutamatergic input from stellate cells in layer 2 and from the
   hippocampus, with both preferentially targeting layer 5b over 5a. Our
   results suggest a molecular and anatomical organization of input-output
   computations in deep layers of the MEC, reveal precise translaminar
   microcircuitry, and identify molecularly defined pathways for spatial
   signals to influence computation in deep layers.},

Title = {Noise promotes independent control of gamma oscillations and grid firing
   within recurrent attractor networks},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Neural computations underlying cognitive functions require calibration
   of the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections and
   are associated with modulation of gamma frequency oscillations in
   network activity. However, principles relating gamma oscillations,
   synaptic strength and circuit computations are unclear. We address this
   in attractor network models that account for grid firing and
   theta-nested gamma oscillations in the medial entorhinal cortex. We show
   that moderate intrinsic noise massively increases the range of synaptic
   strengths supporting gamma oscillations and grid computation. With
   moderate noise, variation in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic strength
   tunes the amplitude and frequency of gamma activity without disrupting
   grid firing. This beneficial role for noise results from disruption of
   epileptic-like network states. Thus, moderate noise promotes independent
   control of multiplexed firing rate-and gamma-based computational
   mechanisms. Our results have implications for tuning of normal circuit
   function and for disorders associated with changes in gamma oscillations
   and synaptic strength.},

Title = {Independent Theta Phase Coding Accounts for CA1 Population Sequences and
   Enables Flexible Remapping},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Hippocampal place cells encode an animal's past, current and future
   location through sequences of action potentials generated within each
   cycle of the network theta rhythm. These sequential representations have
   been suggested to result from temporally coordinated synaptic
   interactions within and between cell assemblies. Instead, we find
   through simulations and analysis of experimental data that rate and
   phase coding in independent neurons is sufficient to explain the
   organization of CA1 population activity during theta states. We show
   that CA1 population activity can be described as an evolving traveling
   wave that exhibits phase coding, rate coding, spike sequences and that
   generates an emergent population theta rhythm. We identify measures of
   global remapping and intracellular theta dynamics as critical for
   distinguishing mechanisms for pacemaking and coordination of sequential
   population activity. Our analysis suggests that, unlike synaptically
   coupled assemblies, independent neurons flexibly generate sequential
   population activity within the duration of a single theta cycle.},

Title = {Laminar and Dorsoventral Molecular Organization of the Medial Entorhinal
   Cortex Revealed by Large-scale Anatomical Analysis of Gene Expression},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode an animal's
   position and orientation in space. Within the MEC spatial
   representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a
   laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar
   topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in
   part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the
   resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the
   molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we
   develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and
   comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution.
   We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen
   Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue
   from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates
   the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its
   laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis
   for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their
   similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of
   superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell
   adhesion-and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional
   differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at
   different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal
   laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest
   that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative
   pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to
   high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuro-anatomical data. Our
   results support the hypothesis that differences in gene expression
   contribute to functional specialization of superficial layers of the MEC
   and dorsoventral organization of the scale of spatial representations.},

Title = {GABAergic Projections from the Medial Septum Selectively Inhibit
   Interneurons in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex},

Abstract = {The medial septum (MS) is required for theta rhythmic oscillations and
   grid cell firing in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). While GABAergic,
   glutamatergic, and cholinergic neurons project from the MS to the MEC,
   their synaptic targets are unknown. To investigate whether MSneurons
   innervate specific layers and cell types in the MEC, we expressed
   channelrhodopsin-2 in mouse MSneurons and used patch-clamp recording in
   brain slices to determine the response to light activation of identified
   cells in the MEC. Following activation of MS axons, we observed fast
   monosynaptic GABAergic IPSPs in the majority (>60\%) of fast-spiking
   (FS) and low-threshold-spiking (LTS) interneurons in all layers of the
   MEC, but in only 1.5\% of nonstellate principal cells (NSPCs) and in no
   stellate cells. We also observed fast glutamatergic responses to MS
   activation in a minority (<5\%) of NSPCs, FS, and LTS interneurons.
   During stimulation of MS inputs at theta frequency (10 Hz), the
   amplitude of GABAergic IPSPs was maintained, and spike output from LTS
   and FS interneurons was entrained at low (25-60 Hz) and high (60-180 Hz)
   gamma frequencies, respectively. By demonstrating cell type-specific
   targeting of the GABAergic projection from the MS to the MEC, our
   results support the idea that the MS controls theta frequency activity
   in the MEC through coordination of inhibitory circuits.},

Title = {Increased intrinsic excitability of muscle vasoconstrictor preganglionic
   neurons may contribute to the elevated sympathetic activity in
   hypertensive rats},

Abstract = {Hypertension is associated with pathologically increased sympathetic
   drive to the vasculature. This has been attributed to increased
   excitatory drive to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) from
   brainstem cardiovascular control centers. However, there is also
   evidence supporting increased intrinsic excitability of SPN. To test
   this hypothesis, we made whole cell recordings of muscle
   vasoconstrictor-like (MVClike) SPN in the working-heart brainstem
   preparation of spontaneously hypertensive (SH) and normotensive
   Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The MVClike SPN have a higher spontaneous
   firing frequency in the SH rat (3.85 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.44 +/- 0.4 Hz in WKY;
   P = 0.011) with greater respiratory modulation of their activity. The
   action potentials of SH SPN had smaller, shorter afterhyperpolarizations
   (AHPs) and showed diminished transient rectification indicating
   suppression of an A-type potassium conductance (I-A). We developed
   mathematical models of the SPN to establish if changes in their
   intrinsic properties in SH rats could account for their altered firing.
   Reduction of the maximal conductance density of I-A by 15-30\% changed
   the excitability and output of the model from the WKY to a SH profile,
   with increased firing frequency, amplified respiratory modulation, and
   smaller AHPs. This change in output is predominantly a consequence of
   altered synaptic integration. Consistent with these in silico
   predictions, we found that intrathecal 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) increased
   sympathetic nerve activity, elevated perfusion pressure, and augmented
   Traube-Hering waves. Our findings indicate that I-A acts as a powerful
   filter on incoming synaptic drive to SPN and that its diminution in the
   SH rat is potentially sufficient to account for the increased
   sympathetic output underlying hypertension.},

Abstract = {Neural computations rely on ion channels that modify neuronal responses
   to synaptic inputs. While single cell recordings suggest diverse and
   neurone type-specific computational functions for HCN1 channels, their
   behavioural roles in any single neurone type are not clear. Using a
   battery of behavioural assays, including analysis of motor learning in
   vestibulo-ocular reflex and rotarod tests, we find that deletion of HCN1
   channels from cerebellar Purkinje cells selectively impairs late stages
   of motor learning. Because deletion of HCN1 modifies only a subset of
   behaviours involving Purkinje cells, we asked whether the channel also
   has functional specificity at a cellular level. We find that HCN1
   channels in cerebellar Purkinje cells reduce the duration of inhibitory
   synaptic responses but, in the absence of membrane hyperpolarization, do
   not affect responses to excitatory inputs. Our results indicate that
   manipulation of subthreshold computation in a single neurone type causes
   specific modifications to behaviour.},

Title = {Prefrontal Cortex HCN1 Channels Enable Intrinsic Persistent Neural

Volume = {33},
Number = {34},
Pages = {13583-13599},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {In many cortical neurons, HCN1 channels are the major contributors to
   I-h, the hyperpolarization-activated current, which regulates the
   intrinsic properties of neurons and shapes their integration of synaptic
   inputs, paces rhythmic activity, and regulates synaptic plasticity.
   Here, we examine the physiological role of I-h in deep layer pyramidal
   neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), focusing on persistent
   activity, a form of sustained firing thought to be important for the
   behavioral function of the PFC during working memory tasks. We find that
   HCN1 contributes to the intrinsic persistent firing that is induced by a
   brief depolarizing current stimulus in the presence of muscarinic
   agonists. Deletion of HCN1 or acute pharmacological blockade of I-h
   decreases the fraction of neurons capable of generating persistent
   firing. The reduction in persistent firing is caused by the membrane
   hyperpolarization that results from the deletion of HCN1 or I-h
   blockade, rather than a specific role of the hyperpolarization-activated
   current in generating persistent activity. In vivo recordings show that
   deletion of HCN1 has no effect on up states, periods of enhanced
   synaptic network activity. Parallel behavioral studies demonstrate that
   HCN1 contributes to the PFC-dependent resolution of proactive
   interference during working memory. These results thus provide genetic
   evidence demonstrating the importance of HCN1 to intrinsic persistent
   firing and the behavioral output of the PFC. The causal role of
   intrinsic persistent firing in PFC-mediated behavior remains an open
   question.},

Title = {Feedback Inhibition Enables Theta-Nested Gamma Oscillations and Grid
   Firing Fields},

Abstract = {Cortical circuits are thought to multiplex firing rate codes with
   temporal codes that rely on oscillatory network activity, but the
   circuit mechanisms that combine these coding schemes are unclear. We
   establish with optogenetic activation of layer II of the medial
   entorhinal cortex that theta frequency drive to this circuit is
   sufficient to generate nested gamma frequency oscillations in synaptic
   activity. These nested gamma oscillations closely resemble activity
   during spatial exploration, are generated by local feedback inhibition
   without recurrent excitation, and have clock-like features suitable as
   reference signals for multiplexing temporal codes within rate-coded grid
   firing fields. In network models deduced from our data, feedback
   inhibition supports coexistence of theta-nested gamma oscillations with
   attractor states that generate grid firing fields. These results
   indicate that grid cells communicate primarily via inhibitory
   interneurons. This circuit mechanism enables multiplexing of
   oscillation-based temporal codes with rate-coded attractor states.},

Title = {Intrinsic electrophysiological properties of entorhinal cortex stellate
   cells and their contribution to grid cell firing fields},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {The medial entorhinal contex (MEC) is an increasingly important focus
   for investigation of mechanisms for spatial representation. Grid cells
   found in layer II of the MEC are likely to be stellate cells, which form
   a major projection to the dentate gyrus. Entorhinal stellate cells are
   distinguished by distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties, but
   how these properties contribute to representation of space is not yet
   clear. Here, we review the ionic conductances, synaptic, and excitable
   properties of stellate cells, and examine thier implication for models
   of grid firing fields. We discuss why existing data are inconsistent
   with models of grid fields that require stellate cells to generate
   periodic oscillation. An alternate possibility is that the intrinsic
   electrophysiological properties of stellate cells are tuned specifically
   to control integration of synaptic input. We highlight recent evidence
   that the dorsal-ventra; organization of synaptic integraiton by stellate
   cells, through differences in currents mediated by HCN and leak
   potassium channels, influences the corresponding organization of grid
   fields. Because accurate cellular data will be important for
   distinguishing mechanisms for generation of grid fields, we introduce
   new date comparing properties measured with whole-cell and perforated
   patch-clamp recordings. We find that clustered patterns of action
   potential firing and the action potential after-hyperpolarization (AHP)
   are particularly sensitive to recording condition. Neverthless, with
   both methods, these properties, resting membrane properties and
   resonance follow a dorsal-ventral organization. Further investigation of
   the molecular basis for synaptic integration by stellate cells will be
   important for understanding mechanisms for generation of grid fields.},

Title = {Dendritic Spine Dynamics Regulate the Long-Term Stability of Synaptic
   Plasticity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {31},
Number = {45},
Pages = {16142-16156},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Long-term synaptic plasticity requires postsynaptic influx of Ca(2+) and
   is accompanied by changes in dendritic spine size. Unless Ca(2+) influx
   mechanisms and spine volume scale proportionally, changes in spine size
   will modify spine Ca(2+) concentrations during subsequent synaptic
   activation. We show that the relationship between Ca(2+) influx and
   spine volume is a fundamental determinant of synaptic stability. If
   Ca(2+) influx is undercompensated for increases in spine size, then
   strong synapses are stabilized and synaptic strength distributions have
   a single peak. In contrast, overcompensation of Ca(2+) influx leads to
   binary, persistent synaptic strengths with double-peaked distributions.
   Biophysical simulations predict that CA1 pyramidal neuron spines are
   undercompensating. This unifies experimental findings that weak synapses
   are more plastic than strong synapses, that synaptic strengths are
   unimodally distributed, and that potentiation saturates for a given
   stimulus strength. We conclude that structural plasticity provides a
   simple, local, and general mechanism that allows dendritic spines to
   foster both rapid memory formation and persistent memory storage.},

Title = {Dorsal-ventral organization of theta-like activity intrinsic to
   entorhinal stellate neurons is mediated by differences in stochastic

Abstract = {The membrane potential dynamics of stellate neurons in layer II of the
   medial entorhinal cortex are important for neural encoding of location.
   Previous studies suggest that these neurons generate intrinsic
   theta-frequency membrane potential oscillations, with a period that
   depends on neuronal location on the dorsal-ventral axis of the medial
   entorhinal cortex, and which in behaving animals could support
   generation of grid-like spatial firing fields. To address the nature and
   organization of this theta-like activity, we adopt the Lomb method of
   least-squares spectral analysis. We demonstrate that peaks in frequency
   spectra that differ significantly from Gaussian noise do not necessarily
   imply the existence of a periodic oscillator, but can instead arise from
   filtered stochastic noise or a stochastic random walk. We show that
   theta-like membrane potential activity recorded from stellate neurons in
   mature brain slices is consistent with stochastic mechanisms, but not
   with generation by a periodic oscillator. The dorsal-ventral
   organization of intrinsic theta-like membrane potential activity, and
   the modification of this activity during block of HCN channels, both
   reflect altered frequency distributions of stochastic spectral peaks,
   rather than tuning of a periodic oscillator. Our results demonstrate the
   importance of distinguishing periodic oscillations from stochastic
   processes. We suggest that dorsal-ventral tuning of theta-like membrane
   potential activity is due to differences in stochastic current
   fluctuations resulting from organization of ion channels that also
   control synaptic integration.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {69},
Number = {5},
Pages = {945-956},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {The axon initial segment (AIS) is critical for the initiation and
   propagation of action potentials. Assembly of the AIS requires
   interactions between scaffolding molecules and voltage-gated sodium
   channels, but the molecular mechanisms that stabilize the AIS are poorly
   understood. The neuronal isoform of Neurofascin, Nfasc186, clusters
   voltage-gated sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated nerves:
   here, we investigate its role in AIS assembly and stabilization.
   Inactivation of the Nfasc gene in cerebellar Purkinje cells of adult
   mice causes rapid loss of Nfasc186 from the AIS but not from nodes of
   Ranvier. This causes AIS disintegration, impairment of motor learning
   and the abolition of the spontaneous tonic discharge typical of Purkinje
   cells. Nevertheless, action potentials with a modified waveform can
   still be evoked and basic motor abilities remain intact. We propose that
   Nfasc186 optimizes communication between mature neurons by anchoring the
   key elements of the adult AIS complex.},

Abstract = {Neuron types are classically defined by anatomical and physiological

   provide an overview of the evidence that, among neurons of a single

   the particular function that individual neurons carry out. Recent data
   suggest that tuning of synaptic responses is not restricted to sensory

   tuning of synaptic integration results from general cellular mechanisms
   for optimization of information processing that are distinct from, but
   complementary to, homeostasis and memory storage. These cellular tuning
   mechanisms might be crucial for distributed computations underlying

Abstract = {We introduce a molecular toolbox for manipulation of neuronal gene
   expression in vivo. The toolbox includes promoters, ion channels,
   optogenetic tools, fluorescent proteins, and intronic artificial
   microRNAs. The components are easily assembled into adeno-associated

   demonstrate assembly of toolbox components into lentivirus and AAV

   artificial microRNA targeted against the ion channel HCN1 (HCN1 miRNA).
   We show that AAV assembled to express HCN1 miRNA produces efficacious

Title = {Stochastic Ion Channel Gating in Dendritic Neurons: Morphology
   Dependence and Probabilistic Synaptic Activation of Dendritic Spikes},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Neuronal activity is mediated through changes in the probability of
   stochastic transitions between open and closed states of ion channels.
   While differences in morphology define neuronal cell types and may
   underlie neurological disorders, very little is known about influences
   of stochastic ion channel gating in neurons with complex morphology. We
   introduce and validate new computational tools that enable efficient
   generation and simulation of models containing stochastic ion channels
   distributed across dendritic and axonal membranes. Comparison of five
   morphologically distinct neuronal cell types reveals that when all
   simulated neurons contain identical densities of stochastic ion
   channels, the amplitude of stochastic membrane potential fluctuations
   differs between cell types and depends on sub-cellular location. For
   typical neurons, the amplitude of membrane potential fluctuations
   depends on channel kinetics as well as open probability. Using a
   detailed model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron, we show that when
   intrinsic ion channels gate stochastically, the probability of
   initiation of dendritic or somatic spikes by dendritic synaptic input
   varies continuously between zero and one, whereas when ion channels gate
   deterministically, the probability is either zero or one. At
   physiological firing rates, stochastic gating of dendritic ion channels
   almost completely accounts for probabilistic somatic and dendritic
   spikes generated by the fully stochastic model. These results suggest
   that the consequences of stochastic ion channel gating differ globally
   between neuronal cell-types and locally between neuronal compartments.
   Whereas dendritic neurons are often assumed to behave deterministically,
   our simulations suggest that a direct consequence of stochastic gating
   of intrinsic ion channels is that spike output may instead be a
   probabilistic function of patterns of synaptic input to dendrites.},

Title = {Stochastically Gating Ion Channels Enable Patterned Spike Firing through
   Activity-Dependent Modulation of Spike Probability},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The transformation of synaptic input into patterns of spike output is a
   fundamental operation that is determined by the particular complement of
   ion channels that a neuron expresses. Although it is well established
   that individual ion channel proteins make stochastic transitions between
   conducting and non-conducting states, most models of synaptic
   integration are deterministic, and relatively little is known about the
   functional consequences of interactions between stochastically gating
   ion channels. Here, we show that a model of stellate neurons from layer
   II of the medial entorhinal cortex implemented with either stochastic or
   deterministically gating ion channels can reproduce the resting membrane
   properties of stellate neurons, but only the stochastic version of the
   model can fully account for perithreshold membrane potential
   fluctuations and clustered patterns of spike output that are recorded
   from stellate neurons during depolarized states. We demonstrate that the
   stochastic model implements an example of a general mechanism for
   patterning of neuronal output through activity-dependent changes in the
   probability of spike firing. Unlike deterministic mechanisms that
   generate spike patterns through slow changes in the state of model
   parameters, this general stochastic mechanism does not require retention
   of information beyond the duration of a single spike and its associated
   afterhyperpolarization. Instead, clustered patterns of spikes emerge in
   the stochastic model of stellate neurons as a result of a transient
   increase in firing probability driven by activation of HCN channels
   during recovery from the spike afterhyperpolarization. Using this model,
   we infer conditions in which stochastic ion channel gating may influence},

Journal = {NEURON},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {60},
Number = {5},
Pages = {875-889},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Neurons important for cognitive function are often classified by their
   morphology and integrative properties. However, it is unclear if within
   a single class of neuron these properties tune synaptic responses to the
   salient features of the information that each neuron represents. We
   demonstrate that for stellate neurons in layer 11 of the medial
   entorhinal cortex, the waveform of postsynaptic potentials, the time
   window for detection of coincident inputs, and responsiveness to gamma
   frequency inputs follow a dorsal-ventral gradient similar to the
   topographical organization of grid-like spatial firing fields of neurons
   in this area. We provide evidence that these differences are due to a
   membrane conductance gradient mediated by HCN and leak potassium
   channels. These findings suggest key roles for synaptic integration in
   computations carried out within the medial entorhinal cortex and imply
   that tuning of neural information processing by membrane ion channels is
   important for normal cognitive function.},

Title = {HCN1 channels control resting and active integrative properties of
   stellate cells from layer II of the entorhinal cortex},

Volume = {27},
Number = {46},

Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Whereas recent studies have elucidated principles for representation of
   information within the entorhinal cortex, less is known about the
   molecular basis for information processing by entorhinal neurons. The
   HCN1 gene encodes ion channels that mediate hyperpolarization-activated
   currents (I-h) that control synaptic integration and influence several
   forms of learning and memory. We asked whether
   hyperpolarization-activated, cation nonselective 1 (HCN1) channels
   control processing of information by stellate cells found within layer
   II of the entorhinal cortex. Axonal projections from these neurons form
   a major component of the synaptic input to the dentate gyrus of the
   hippocampus. To determine whether HCN1 channels control either the
   resting or the active properties of stellate neurons, we performed
   whole-cell recordings in horizontal brain slices prepared from adult
   wild-type and HCN1 knock-out mice. We found that HCN1 channels are
   required for rapid and full activation of hyperpolarization-activated
   currents in stellate neurons. HCN1 channels dominate the membrane
   conductance at rest, are not required for theta frequency (4-12 Hz)
   membrane potential fluctuations, but suppress low-frequency (< 4 Hz)
   components of spontaneous and evoked membrane potential activity. During
   sustained activation of stellate cells sufficient for firing of repeated
   action potentials, HCN1 channels control the pattern of spike output by
   promoting recovery of the spike afterhyperpolarization. These data
   suggest that HCN1 channels expressed by stellate neurons in layer II of
   the entorhinal cortex are key molecular components in the processing of
   inputs to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, with distinct integrative roles
   during resting and active states.},
